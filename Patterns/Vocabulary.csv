TODO not correct
problem here
Bad code
Is there no better way?
TODO: Is this needed?
Todo: Does this help?
Would it not better be
Find a better way to do this
not possible to do better
Todo: Is this a good way?
probably better ways to implement this
is not the correct way
not entirely correct
other way to implement
could probably do better
big arrays
Clean Up
clone code
Future enhancement
Ignore the error
It 's an error
god class
Harder to fix
large class
Never implemented
no sense
not implemented
not necessary
not really needed
Quality problem
Slow performance
test score for nothing
tired to think
Unnecessary code
Violation of modularity
What?
What do we do
What about?
Don't appear to be used
not used in the new APIs
not used
code is not used
no faults are fixed
not work
Todo: This does not work
TODO: check if this works
cyclic dependency
dependency cycle
Why is this not done
Todo: Why do I need to do this?
Why are these gone?
Todo: Why is this here?
why synchronized?
Todo: Why was
TODO: why is this inside a block?
Todo: Why does it fail
causes and exception
not seem to define this name
show some documentation?
Not are useful here
nobody is using
nobody ever looks
is there a problem
I don't think
For debugging
let's be sure
I don't understant
not sure why
It causes the feedback loop
must be re-introduced to solve
may be optimised
Is there any other way?
not the right location
Will be able
probably redundant
it is used in several places
clone of this code
Need to Copy
chose not to do this
Todo: Which is best?
This is a bug
cause issue
not according
is not a valid one
is slightly different than what's documented
cause problem
still has some problems
Todo: does not handle
Todo: Handle
TODO: I don't think it's normal
TODO: I don't think it's normal
THIS IS A HACK
memory cosuming
Todo: This needs more work!
Todo: does not work
to be safe
take care
inherited problems
problems directly in
contains some errors
FIXME: this could be a problem
Low code coverage
Bad coding practies
Time consuming
Deficiency in testing activities
necessity of understanding
Work in progress here
Note: This is temporary
TODO: maybe should stop
need to be in their own files?
A much better way
defined in the ToDoItem
changes the complete structure
Who is calling this?
manually created todo item
Todo: This probably belongs
needs documenting
Information that is required
replace the deprecated
currently not used
not support Java 1.3 any more
need to be fixed
Todo: We could also support
problems directly in this class
need to do anything here?
good solution?
Todo: improve algorithm
What to do
Note: maybe
Todo: correctly implement
Todo: This is a temporary method
I don't understand
Todo: This is not according
Todo: This needs work
unwanted dependency
all memory allocated
to free memory
bug workaround
Workaround for a bug
this sucks
timing-dependent
TODO: maybe we should resolve
TODO: maybe take here?
TODO maybe it would make
should never happen
will never be
makes no sense
known problem
is not enough
make sense?
broken down
horribly Inefficient
consume very large
modular violation
large coupled
Not recommended
not sure
Problem of performance
needes to be cleared
need to factor
Should be overriden
no longer be used
barely understood
bad smell
deprecated code
deprecated api
would be better
probably a bug
Todo: Add implementation
Todo: Add
Todo: Fix
Remove All
remove dependencies later
Remove the dependent
remove literal
move to the correct owner
Todo: Change
Need to be amended
Not created yet
deprecated call
to be verified
Todo: Check the name
maybe can be implemented
is not yet completely implemented
not yet used
is not updated
how do we resolve this?
TODO: resolve item
has to be
have to set
have to move
Have to add
TODO: Do we really have to test
have to delete it later
Have to do
must be resized
need to clone
need to refactor
need to set
Need to be reviewed
Need to be updated
need to be moved someplace useful
need to be
Todo: Not sure we need to do this
need to jump
should be visible
Why should it pass?
should be taken out
I don't think
should be fixed
This should NOT be looking
should actually not be placed here
should not be necessary
should not have
not to do this to keep architecture stable
doesn't do anything
Will be needed
shall never
Should find
should handle
Should modify
here?
Todo: Here we should
Will be hard work
arbitrary dimensions
somewhat inconsistent
method is unsafe
Dirty fix
temporary solution
possible future improvement
future maintenance
future potential optimizations
Future release
in the Future
unnecessarily complicated
This case is complicated
Todo: required
TODO: Is this required?
Remove duplicates
not quite right
get confused
confusing name
Code so long?
difficult to maintain
extra work
perhaps move to
fails the test
can fail
assert fails
never called
never have
repeated code
rather bad
alternative implementation
very expensive
Note: loose type
Note: kind of far-fetched
Note: This class is messy
XXX: hairy code
Should be careful
plainly impossible
binding bug
This is not a sufficient
weird hack
can be expensive
This could possibly hurt performance
is not reliable as a unit test
fully opaque
seems wrong
something's gone wrong
Todo: implement this
Todo: Party overlaps
Todo: Update
can be deleted
can probably have
clone method
have to use
later use
must be moved
must come before
must notify modification
need to check
need to extend
need to listen
need to verify
TODO: indicate the direction!
will be useful
would seem to imply
will be replaced
update the model
Calls are ORDER DEPENDENT
Do we need
loops are double
may be no need
"now remove the pool, too"
reduce the number
references to elements of other packages?
will cause
good idea?
