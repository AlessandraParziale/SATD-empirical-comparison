Naturally * 	 12|1|[] and 12|2|[] conflict, but we cannot stop processing this node * 	 because alternative to has another way to continue, via [6|2|[]]. * 	 The key is that we have a single state that has config's only associated * 	 with a single alternative, 2, and crucially the state transitions * 	 among the configurations are all non-epsilon transitions. That means * 	 we don't consider any conflicts that include alternative 2. So, we * 	 ignore the conflict between alts 1 and 2.

For example,// suppose we're currently on a 1GB node with a 21MB job running and a 970MB job waiting.// If we scale up to a 2GB node then both will fit. But if we don't consider the free// memory on the 1GB node then we'll scale up to 4GB, then later scale back down to 2GB.// However, there's a complication. Assigning jobs is in reality a bin-packing problem// but we're modelling it as a simple summation problem. If we had 970MB of free space// spread over multiple existing nodes then we very well might need to scale up to fit// a 970MB job, but subtracting the current free memory from the requirement would lead// to us not scaling up at all. We don't have enough control to solve this correctly,// but a heuristic that's better than doing nothing is to at least consider the amount// of free space on the current node with the most free space and subtract that from the// requirement. In our example with the 21MB and 970MB jobs on the 1GB node, we'll then// correctly scale to 2GB. The more nodes in the cluster the worse the heuristic will do// but it won't ever be worse than doing nothing, many clusters only have a small number// of ML nodes, and by the time we get to large nodes the scaling steps are big anyway// so we are less likely to incorrectly skip a level due to this problem.[[SEP]]// If we get here in production it means there's a bug somewhere else, but it's// better to scale in the pre-8.3 way than not scale at all if this happens[[SEP]]// Could the currently waiting jobs ever be assigned?// NOTE: the previous predicate catches if an allocated model isn't assigned[[SEP]]// we are unable to determine new tier size, but maybe we can see if our nodes are big enough.[[SEP]]// we have no info, allow the caller to make the appropriate action, probably returning a no_scale[[SEP]]// could any of the nodes actually run the job?[[SEP]]// it is OK to continue here as we have not breached our queuing limit[[SEP]]// it is OK to continue here as we have not breached our queuing limit[[SEP]]// it is OK to continue here as we have not breached our queuing limit",1

7164,"// -------- backwards compatibility with 1.5, 1.6 -----------[[SEP]]/*        Please see FLINK-11436 for details on why manual deserialization is required.        During the release of Flink 1.7, the value of serialVersionUID was uptick to 2L (was 1L before)        And although the AvroSerializer (along with it's snapshot class) were migrated to the new serialization        abstraction (hence free from Java serialization), there were composite serializers that were not migrated        and were serialized with Java serialization. In case that one of the nested serializers were Avro we would        bump into deserialization exception due to a wrong serialVersionUID. Unfortunately it is not possible to revert        the serialVersionUID back to 1L, because users might have snapshots with 2L present already.        To overcome this we first need to make sure that the AvroSerializer is being Java deserialized with        FailureTolerantObjectInputStream, and then we determine the serialized layout by looking at the fields.

To complicate things even further in pre 1.7, the field @schemaString could be        null or a string, but, in post 1.7, the field @previousSchema was never set to null, therefore        we can use the first field to determine the version.        this logic should stay here as long as we support Flink 1.6 (along with Java serialized        TypeSerializers)        */[[SEP]]// first field can only be NULL in 1.6 (schemaString)[[SEP]]// first field is a String only in 1.6 (schemaString)[[SEP]]// first field is a Class<?> only in 1.5 (type)",0
